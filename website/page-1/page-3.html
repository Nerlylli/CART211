<!--This page is about how capitalism has changed our ways of consuming. 
Make comparison to before, when we used to own everything. Streaming was not a thing. You needed to buy music, etc.-->

                <p>Nowadays, we can easily watch shows and movies through streaming platforms. Paying a monthly
                    subscription fee is all we need to provide ourselves
                    access to the desired media.
                    <br>If we want to listen to music, we have multiples choices. Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music and
                    more.

                <h2>ILLUSION OF CHOICE</h2>
                <p><br>Having multiple subscriptions to different streaming and music platforms, gives us a false
                    sense of control regarding the media that we consume in our day to day life. In fact, it is the
                    access that we own, not the media. Back in the day, it was common to own physical media for
                    everything; music, tv shows, movies, books, and more. However, the digitization of these things,
                    under the pretext of modernizatiob, is a capitalistic tool to continuously make us spend money on
                    things we don't, and never will, own.
                    <br> In fact, platforms like Netflix often take out movies and shows from the platform,making
                    subscribers unable to watch them like they used to before.

Usseewa is a song by Ado, where she is putting out one of her best vocal performances to capture the song’s intensity and pure anger towards society, in this particular case, Japanese society. The Japanese word Usseewa, translate to shut up. The lyrics ‘<em>Understanding the latest trends;<br>
Checking the stock market on my way to work;<br>
Joining a company with the pure spirit;<br>
These are the obvious rules for us workers<em>’, <br>
depict a girl who’s fed up with the society she lives in and its work culture that is driven by capitalism, which tells people that working harder and harder will get them closer to success and financial stability">

Focusing on authencity, rather than compsumption, <br>exposing the absurdity of how image culture is often
