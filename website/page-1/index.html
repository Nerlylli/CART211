                <p><strong>f5ve - Underground</strong><br>Despite the upbeat melody, the song <em>‘Underground’</em>
                    by
                    f5ve, has a deep message about the
                    social
                    pressures brought on by
                    capitalism, making people want to withdraw from the outside world and live in the underground.
                    In
                    the song, that place
                    is used as a metaphor, both for capitalism, as well as a critique of it. At first, the metro – a
                    public transit system
                    frequently utilized by the working class to commute – serves as a representation of the
                    underground
                    world they are
                    trying to escape. Later on in the video, that same underground world transforms into a rave, and
                    into a subterranean
                    automobile meet, which is where they feel free.

                <p><strong>Capitalism is the source of many issues.</strong> <br>
                    <strong>For example, the digital spying that takes place on
                        practically every platform
                        on our devices.</strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Majority of them are free.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>We use the internet and register on social
                        media sites with the
                        hope that our privacy will be protected by using our email address, and a unique password
                        for
                        each site.</strong></p>
                <strong>But the
                    true question is: How do these large corporations still manage to generate revenue?</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>Although being free to use, they
                    managed to continue
                    operating for so long; how?</strong>
                <p><strong>The answer, our <em>data</em>.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Google makes money by knowing where we are,
                        where
                        we are going, who
                        our connections are, and more.</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Similar companies compete for our attention, accomplishing this through
                        the development of
                        interest-based algorithms and technical advancements.</strong></p>
                <strong>In short, in a capitalist society, nothing
                    is
                    free.</strong><br>
                <strong>If you are not
                    paying for the product, you are the product.</strong>
