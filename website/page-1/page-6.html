                <p>Imagination is not something that we learn; rather, it is something that we, <br>as
                    humans, tend to lose over time because
                    of school, work, and other <br>obligations. For this reason, art is crucial to society. In a world
                    full
                    of
                    social <br>norms, art
                    enables people to challenge them by self-expressing themselves <br>in so many ways. That is why the
                    use
                    of
                    AI is in no way
                    ethical, especially <br>in this specific field. However, because its use seems to be becoming
                    <br>somewhat
                    inevitable, it should
                    be regulated, as the boundaries between<br> inspiration and blatant plagiarism sometimes blur.

                    Ai is continuously evolving. <br>With its rapid updates comes the fear of it replacing humans in
                    many
                    fields. <br>However, the
                    problem does not only lie within its presence, but rather the <br>ways in which people use it, often
                    to
                    prompt things that
                    could’ve easily been <br>done by humans. In fact, AI imitates and spits out an artificially
                    generated<br>
                    version, using the
                    tools and stylistic elements that artists spend their <br>lives developing and coming up with.

                    AI opens the door to commodify these <br>things, making them faster and cheaper. The ways in which
                    some
                    interact with <br>this
                    tool have caused us to become impatient, leading us to expect instant<br> results and gratification,
                    underestimating the
                    necessity of the process. In the <br>field of art, however, it is not always the piece itself that
                    is
                    interesting or
                    <br> impressive, but the story behind it. What is it about? What is the piece <br>portraying? What
                    does
                    it
                    say
                    about the time
                    period, about the artist? Art is a <br>way to connect with one another, free of language barriers
                    and
                    time
                    spaces. <br>In fact,
                    art was humans’ first language.AI is a product of capitalism.
                    To support <br>the development of AI, is to oppose our own growth.
